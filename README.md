# Android Malware Detection
## Project Description
This is a  malware detection data mining ML project with android dataset.
## Project Progress
### Progress so far
#### Completed Tasks: 
We have sucessfully completed the following parts of the project: Dataset selection, Data Preprocessing, Data Mining pipeline transformation, Split train and test data samples, implementation of KNN classifier and it's performance evaluation.
#### Data: 
The dataset is collected from kaggle site. Here inserted the link of the dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/android-permission-dataset

### Challenges
#### Encountered Difficulties: 
1. Face difficulties to find suitable dataset for the project.
2. Face problem to work the dataset with mix datatypes.

### Collaboration 
We go for group discussion weekly twice or more according to our project task requirements. And the team members involvements are effective and safisfactory.

### Next steps
#### Remaining Tasks: 
Implementation of Random Forest, SVM classifier, Naive Bayes, AdaBoost and as well as there performance evaluation. And reach to a conclusion about the model.
Plan to complete the remaining tasks on the upcoming weeks.
#### Potential challenges: 
The classifiers can not be performed as expected.
